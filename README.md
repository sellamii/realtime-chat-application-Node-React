A full Realtime Chat Application.

I'm using  React on the front end, with NodeJS + Socket.io web socket library on the back end. 

+ how to send and receive messages using web sockets and Socket.io to make any real-time application.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
